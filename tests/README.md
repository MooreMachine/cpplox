# Testing

The tests are written in C++ using the [GoogleTest framework](https://github.com/google/googletest). We are specifically using [version 1.11.0](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases/tag/release-1.11.0).

Right now, to keep things simple, we install GoogleTest using the recommended steps in the [CMake quickstart page](https://google.github.io/googletest/quickstart-cmake.html#set-up-a-project).
